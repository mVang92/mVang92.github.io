# Meng Vang Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio. This portfolio was created to demonstrate what I have accomplished during the six month full-stack web development coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. I have created this portfolio from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Posted on my site are some of my best individual and group projects I built during my time in the course. I will also add more projects to this list going forward.

## Theme

The main theme to my portfolio web site is based on lightgrey and red colors. Inspired by the Windows Aero theme from Windows Vista and Windows 7, the main background and borders for the container are slightly transparent enough to allow the background image to come through. The transparency color is white, as white mixes well with most colored themes. A one pixel solid black border surrounds the container in order to better separate the container from the background.

## More on the Pages

Aside from the picture in the About page, I also increased the size of my name and my role to make it easier for the user to see. The third line down, known as my headline, will randomly change the phrase upon page refresh. I will be adding more to improve this page in the near future.

In the Portfolio page, this is where I list all of my best projects. Clicking on the "Individual Projects" and "Group Projects" buttons will display the projects in their respected  categories. In the desktop environment, hovering over the projects with the mouse will highlight the specific project as well as change the mouse cursor to a pointer.

The Contact page includes my contact information and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverFlow page. Using Firebase, I can store the information submitted by my viewers.

Lastly, the background image on each page will change automatically to reflect the northern hemisphere seasons.
