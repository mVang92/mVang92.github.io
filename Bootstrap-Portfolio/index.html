                        <span id="hello"></span> After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
                        Science
                        Informations Systems at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls in 2015, I have been
                        seeking
                        a career in Web Development. As technology plays such a large role in today's modern
                        society,
                        the search for talented individuals is in great demand. With the skills and knowledge
                        obtained
                        through schooling and private learning, I plan to show off my skills and talents by
                        designing
                        interactive web applications.

                <div class="aboutMe aboutMeInfo">
                    I am very confident in myself to learn new skills and technologies so concepts can be made into
                    a functional application. With great interests in Web Development, I plan to gain new skills for
                    developing innovative
                    web applications to increase productivity and efficiency throughout large companies and clients one
                    day.
